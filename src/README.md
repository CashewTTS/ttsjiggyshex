# Generating hexagon pieces

The knobs.txt file contains a set of random knobs extracted from brainsick's original obj files, one per line, each consisting of a list of 2D points with (0,0) implied before the first and (1, 0) implied after the last. This file can be regenerated by running extract_knobs.py if those original obj files are present in the right location (edit the path in the main function if needed).

To generate the hexagon pieces, run create_pieces.py after modifying the main function as desired with the list of puzzles to generate. Then copy the console output into the TTS mod's Lua script. Other small changes to the Lua script and UI xml may be needed to show the puzzle list correctly, but are not provided here. Ensure the generated files are available to TTS (e.g. hosted on GitHub) before running the mod.
